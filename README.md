# OKCSharp
A god awful API Wrapper for OKCupid

# Why are there only 3 methods
There's actually 5 but the other 2 requre using GraphQL and every sigle query I send returns an error message even if it's a direct copy of a request that works

# Where do I see the documentation for OKCupid's API?
HAHAHA\
HAHA\

You're doing it all manually via the dev console. Limit the type to `application/json` and enjoy reading the responses and requests while thinking of reasons to live.
